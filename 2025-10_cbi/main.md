## In one slide:

Collective bargaining in the information economy / Collective bargaining for information (CBI) = data creators and stewards negotiate with AI builders around data use.


Why?

- friction in information markets to prevent power concentration
- incentives to produce trustworthy information (involves: recording the state of the world, creating high quality structured content and records).

Making CBI operational will require a coalition across research, policy, and practice, with a focus on coordination of wins (e.g. ensure that technical work on data attribution and control feeds directly into regulation; design regulation so that it is easier to do this technical work).

---

## Immediate Asks

- Information creators (e.g., researchers, writers, artists, coders): create and join data intermediaries that handle flow of data to AI builders
- Technical community (ML, HCI): deliver interpretability, attribution/valuation, and data control tools
- Regulators: provide antitrust safe harbors for CBI
- AI safety & policy circles: treat CBI as core power-balancing work
- Tech companies: engage in good-faith CBI to improve trust and data quality (for many tech companies, will create better products + maintain good relations with customers).

---

## Core Idea

- Some friction around information acquisition/transactions is needed to prevent power concentration and maintain incentives to create new knowledge

---

## Why AI Exacerbates Information Market Failures

In short: there are well known issues with designing markets for information/data/knowledge. AI progress makes it easier for powerful actors to extract value from data while eroding previous compensation/governance mechanisms.

- Information is cheap to copy, hard to exclude, often nonrivalrous
- Create issues with pricing. Humans have a long-history of attempts to create imperfect property rights around data/information/knowledge
- Stronger models threaten existing imperfect solutions, make it easier for powerful actors to extract value from datasets
- Potential for financial, informational, and decision power to centralize

## What Is CBI?

Bargaining between:
- Data intermediaries that represent creators, curators, and communities
- AI operators who rely on their data to train and deploy models

Negotiations cover fair terms of use, compensation, downstream limits, and transparency

---

## CBI Is Already Emerging

- Data deals (content platforms like Reddit), labor negotiations that center AI (e.g. SAG-AFTRA)
- A coordinated coalition can move beyond scattered deals
- Not a cure-all, but a practical lever for better near-term and long-term equilibria

---

## The Stakes

- Political and moral risk of power concentration: democratic instability, narrowed creative diversity, feedback loops (feedback loops are scary!)
- Technical risks: fragile data ecosystems (both volunteer communities like Wikipedia and professional industries like journalism) -> less reliable models

---

## Technical Foundations for Bargaining

- Data value estimation (influence functions, data Shapley, etc.) can help pricing
- Scaling and selection studies chart payoff trajectories for new or different data
- Data poisoning and robustness work clarifies the cost of ignoring negotiated safeguards
- Algorithmic collective action offers tooling for coordinated data supply

Together these methods ground bargaining in credible counterfactual evidence.

## Complements alternative views

- Solve via open-source approach?
- Solve via top-down regulation?

Can complement both and fill gaps (mainly: solving the incentive problem)!

## Takeaway

A healthy information economy incentivizes the creation and curation of information and distributes power more evenly.

Collective bargaining for information is one step toward that goal—reach out if you want to help build it.
