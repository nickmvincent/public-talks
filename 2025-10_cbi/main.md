## Jumping right in with our concrete asks

| Stakeholder | Action |
|--------------|---------|
| Information industries (research, writing, art) | Form joint ventures, negotiate terms; in some cases, pause un-negotiated training access |
| Regulators | Offer antitrust safe harbors for collective bargaining |
| ML researchers | Advance interpretability and data valuation methods |
| HCI designers | Build usable interfaces for data control |
| AI safety community | Treat CBI as part of power-balancing safety work |
| Tech companies | Engage with CBI to earn trust and improve data quality |

---

## Core Idea

Our core idea: we need Collective Bargaining in the Information Economy (CBI).

CBI will allow people who create or steward information to negotiate fair terms with AI builders.

---

## CBI at high Level

At the highest level: there must be some frictions in information markets to prevent runaway power accumulation.
Further, there must be some incentive to record the world or create new content.

CBI can support both.

---

## Why AI Exacerbates Information Market Failures

Without CBI, (we think that) AI will deepen familiar information market failures.

- Properties of information:
  - cheap to copy (hard to exclude)
  - often nonrivalrous
  - prices collapse
  - see history of attempts to introduce imperfect property rights over info/data
  - See current wages and working conditions for data work  

---

## Why AI Exacerbates Information Market Failures

AI magnifies issues with information markets and weakens incentives to produce new knowledge.  

Better models ("more AI capabilities") reduce informational friction by:
- Making it easier to extract value from data  
- Weakening the practical force of IP protections  

We expect in long term, without CBI, this will lead to tighter concentration of financial, informational, and decision power (more in paper and in other recent related work).

---

## The Need for Coordinated Intervention / Forming a Coalition

We need coordinated social+legal+technical interventions to rebalance the market for information.

Ideally, technical research and policy can benefit each other.


---

## What Is CBI?

Bargaining between:
- Data intermediaries (collectives, guilds, syndicates, etc.) that represent groups of information producers  
- AI operators using data to build models  

---

Typical topics include:
- Terms of data use  
- Compensation mechanisms  
- Limits on downstream applications  
- Reporting and transparency requirements

---


## CBI is already happening

It's already happening (data deals, AI stipulation in contracts like SAG-AFTRA)

But there is not currently an explicit coalition of AI researchers, policymakers, etc. working to support effective CBI.

---

## Not a cure all

CBI is not a cure-all, but it can give people a realistic lever in the near term and create healthier equilibrium in the long-term (zero friction is likely *not healthy* and *not safe*).

---


## Consequences of Power Concentration

(Worth stating, we think)

Political and moral risks:
- Democratic instability  
- Loss of creative and moral diversity  
- Feedback loops that entrench the most powerful actors
  
Technical and economic risks:
- Collapse of high-quality "data ecosystems"  
- Reduced AI reliability and diversity  

---

## Why CBI Is a "Safety" Strategy

CBI:
- Distributes control over informational resources  
- Creates accountability through trusted intermediaries  
- Enables auditing and model evaluation with privately held data  
- Encourages data-centric investment instead of pure compute escalation  

---

## Technical Foundations: Data Counterfactuals

Various research efforts give us tools to ask how models would perform under different data scenarios:
- Data value estimation (influence functions, data Shapley, new stuff: metagradients, small value estimation models) prices individual or pooled contributions  
- Data scaling and selection studies show performance trajectories as datasets grow or shift  
- Data poisoning work probes worst-case impacts when inputs are manipulated  
- Algorithmic collective action explores how groups can coordinate data supply, gain leverage  

Together, these methods map the space of "what if we had different data?" scenarios that matter to bargaining.

---

## Why This Matters for CBI

- Value estimation so data creators/stewards can estimate marginal contribution  
- Scaling analyses highlight when new data types or communities unlock significant gains  
- Poisoning resistance research underscores the need for negotiated quality and safety commitments  
- Collective action theory shows how shared tools can transform individual contributions into bargaining power  

As these techniques mature, they equip intermediaries with credible evidence to negotiate terms grounded in measurable impact.

---

## Building the Coalition

We propose an inclusive, cross-disciplinary effort connecting:

- Researchers  
- Information producers  
- AI developers  
- Policymakers  
- Civil society organizations 

(Everybody we can get on board!)

Goal: coordinate! Use data attribution technical work to guide policy. Make policy that supports better data attribution technical work.

---

## Complementary Approaches

Open AI ecosystems can spread access but can not, on their own, fix incentive issues.

Top-down regulation is necessary yet insufficient.  

(More in the paper / talk to us about this!)

---

## Thank you!

A healthy information economy incentivizes the creation and curation of information and distributes power more evenly.

Collective bargaining for information is one step toward that goal.
