# Position: Collective Bargaining in the Information Economy Can Address AI-Driven Power Concentration
### NeurIPS Position Papers 2025 short video

## Immediate Asks

- Information creators: organize, negotiate, or pause unnegotiated training access
- Technical community (ML, HCI): deliver interpretability, valuation, and data control tools
- Regulators: provide antitrust safe harbors for collective bargaining on information use
- AI safety & policy circles: treat CBI as core power-balancing work
- Tech companies: engage in good-faith CBI to improve trust and data quality

---

## Core Idea

- Collective Bargaining in the Information Economy (CBI) gives information stewards leverage with AI builders
- Healthy friction restrains power concentration and keeps incentives to create new knowledge

---

## Why AI Deepens Market Failures

- Information is cheap to copy, nonrivalrous, and chronically under-compensated
- Stronger models extract more value and weaken practical IP protections
- Without CBI, financial, informational, and decision power centralizes

---

## What Is CBI?

Bargaining between:
- Data intermediaries that represent creators, curators, and communities
- AI operators who rely on their data to train and deploy models

Negotiations cover fair terms of use, compensation, downstream limits, and transparency

---

## CBI Is Already Emerging

- Data deals, cultural labor contracts, and guild experiments show early traction
- A coordinated coalition can move this from scattered deals to durable infrastructure
- Not a cure-all, but a practical lever for better near-term and long-term equilibria

---

## Power & Safety Stakes

- Political and moral risks: democratic instability, narrowed creative diversity, entrenched elites
- Technical and economic risks: fragile data ecosystems, less reliable models, feedback loops favoring incumbents
- CBI distributes control, creates accountable intermediaries, and prioritizes data-centric investment

---

## Technical Foundations for Bargaining

- Data value estimation (influence functions, data Shapley, metagradients) prices contributions
- Scaling and selection studies chart payoff trajectories for new or different data
- Data poisoning and robustness work clarifies the cost of ignoring negotiated safeguards
- Algorithmic collective action offers tooling for coordinated data supply

Together these methods ground bargaining in credible counterfactual evidence.

---

## Coalition & Complementary Approaches

- Connect researchers, information producers, AI developers, policymakers, and civil society to align incentives
- Pair policy support with technical attribution to reinforce both
- Open ecosystems and top-down regulation help, but CBI supplies the missing bargaining mechanism

---

## Takeaway

A healthy information economy incentivizes the creation and curation of information and distributes power more evenly.

Collective bargaining for information is one step toward that goal—reach out if you want to help build it.
