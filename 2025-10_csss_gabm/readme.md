Hello!

Here are some links for my CSSS talk.

See the .pdf file and .md file for the slides-as-pdf and slides-as-markdown-source (produced using MARP), respectively.

Here is a Semantic Scholar collection with all the papers mentioned: https://www.semanticscholar.org/shared/library/folder/13133563?utm_source=direct_link

Here is my website: nickmvincent.com

On social media (Bluesky, hci.social, I am also still on Twitter for now...) you can find me using the handle @nickmvincent
